  abstract =      {The understanding, and even the description of
                   protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the
                   process. Much of this complexity can be described and
                   understood by taking a statistical approach to the
                   energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the
                   energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape
                   approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such
                   as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins
                   and more generally explains the distinction between
                   folding processes common to all sequences and those
                   peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also
                   gives new, quantitative insights into the
                   interpretation of experiments and simulations of
                   protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics.
                   Specifically, the picture provides simple
                   explanations for folding as a two‐state
                   first‐order phase transition, for the origin of
                   metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the
                   curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory
                   experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The
                   relation of these quantitative ideas to folding
                   pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential
                   behavior in protein folding experiments and to the
                   effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The
                   success of energy landscape ideas in protein
                   structure prediction is also described. The use of
                   the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is
                   illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some
                   recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of
                   experiments on the folding of three proteins. The
                   work unifies several previously proposed ideas
                   concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits
                   the regions of validity of these ideas under
                   different thermodynamic conditions. {\textcopyright}

                   statistical description of a protein's potential
                   surface. It assumes that folding occurs through
                   organizing an ensemble of structures rather than
                   through only a few uniquely defined structural
                   intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic
                   model of a protein is a minimally frustrated
                   heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape
                   biased toward the native structure. This statistical
                   description has been developed using tools from the
                   statistical mechanics of disordered systems,
                   polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We
                   review here its analytical background and contrast
                   the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers,
                   and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically

                   take about 8,000 years under physiological
                   conditions. Despite extensive studies, a
                   comprehensive understanding of kinase energy
                   landscapes, including both chemical and
                   conformational steps, is lacking. Here we scrutinize
                   the microscopic steps in the catalytic cycle of
                   adenylate kinase, through a combination of NMR
                   measurements during catalysis, pre-steady-state

                   crystallography of active complexes. We find that the
                   Mg2+ cofactor activates two distinct molecular
                   events: phosphoryl transfer (>105-fold) and lid

                   the barriers of the adsorption/desorption from DFT
                   calculations is thus still not available. In this
                   work, we choose CO adsorption/desorption on Pt(111)
                   as a model for two reasons. First, it is often a
                   rate-limiting step in many catalytic reactions.
                   Second, the disagreement between the experiment and
                   DFT calculations on the CO adsorption sites of
                   Pt(111) has been known as "the CO puzzle" in the

                   desirable. We introduce a molecular dynamics method
                   within the framework of DFT, allowing us to calculate
                   the free energy barriers of adsorption/desorption

                   chemisorption on the hollow site is found, and the

                   wide range of molecular phenomena. The problem of how
                   a denatured protein re-folds to its active state
                   (Levinthal's paradox) has been addressed in terms of
                   the underlying energy landscape, as has the widely
                   used 'strong' and 'fragile' classification of
                   liquids. Here we show how three archetypal energy
                   landscapes for clusters of atoms or molecules can be
                   characterized in terms of the disconnectivity graphs
                   of their energy minima - that is, in terms of the
                   pathways that connect minima at different threshold
                   energies. First we consider a cluster of 38
                   Lennard-Jones particles, whose energy landscape is a
                   'double funnel' on which relaxation to the global
                   minimum is diverted into a set of competing
                   structures. Then we characterize the energy landscape
                   associated with the annealing of C60 cages of
                   buckministerfullerene, and show that it provides
                   experimentally accessible clues to the relaxation
                   pathway. Finally we show a very different landscape
                   morphology, that of a model water cluster (H2O)20,
                   and show how it exhibits features expected for a
                   'strong' liquid. These three examples do not exhaust
                   the possibilities, and might constitute substructures
                   of still more complex landscapes.},

                   is highly sensitive to both environmental

                   amplitude and shape of geometric imperfections and,
                   additionally, quantitative results for the energy
                   barrier that must be overcome to buckle the shell by
                   extraneous loadings or disturbances when it is loaded
                   to pressures below the buckling pressure. Results for
                   the simultaneous interaction of imperfections and
                   energy barriers for spherical shells under external
                   pressure will be presented. Numerical studies for
                   probing forces illustrate their use in determining
                   the buckling energy barrier, and new experimental
                   results on energy barriers obtained by others by
                   probing spherical shells will be discussed and
                   compared with predictions. It will be argued that
                   while imperfections determine the buckling load of a
                   shell, the energy barrier at loads below the buckling
                   load supplies important additional information about
                   the relative safety or precariousness of the shell to
                   additional disturbances. Results for the energy
                   barrier for perfect and imperfect spherical shells
                   under external pressure provide important insights
                   into the shell's robustness, or lack thereof, at
                   pressures below the buckling pressure. In particular,
                   the energy barrier trends provide critical insights
                   into the low knockdown factor usually employed in
                   establishing the design load of unstiffened spherical
                   and cylindrical shells. These design loads are shown
                   to correlate with conventional predictions provided
                   that imperfection amplitudes scale as the shell
                   radius.},

                   role across a wide range of industrial applications.
                   Recent advances of nanotechnology have made possible
                   the manipulation of the condensation process through
                   the control of surface structures. In this work, we
                   study vapor condensation on hydrophobic surfaces
                   patterned with microscale pillars. The critical
                   nuclei, the activation barriers, and the minimum
                   energy paths are computed using the climbing string
                   method. The effects of pillar height, interpillar
                   spacing, the level of supersaturation, and the
                   intrinsic wettability of the solid surface on the
                   nucleation process are investigated. Two nucleation
                   scenarios are obtained from the computation. In the
                   case of high pillar, narrow interpillar spacing, low
                   supersaturation, and/or low surface wettability, the
                   critical nucleus prefers the suspended Cassie state;
                   otherwise, it prefers the impaled Wenzel state. A
                   comparison of the nucleation barrier with that on a
                   flat surface of the same material reveals that vapor
                   condensation is inhibited by the microstructures in
                   the former case, while enhanced in the latter case.
                   The critical values of the pillar height, the
                   interpillar spacing, and the supersaturation at which
                   the critical nucleus changes from the Cassie state to
                   the Wenzel state are identified from the phase
                   diagram of the critical nucleus. It is found that the
                   dependence of the critical interpillar spacing on the
                   supersaturation follows closely the curve of the
                   critical radii in a homogeneous nucleation. The
                   relaxation dynamics of the condensate after the
                   critical nucleus is formed is computed by solving the
                   steepest descent equation. It is observed that when
                   the pillar is low and/or the interpillar spacing is
                   wide, a condensate initially in the Cassie state may
                   evolve into the Wenzel state during the relaxation.},

                   Despite recent substantial advances in fabrication
                   methods for reentrant and doubly reentrant
                   microstructures, design optimization remains a major
                   challenge. We overcome this in two stages. First, we
                   develop readily generalizable computational methods
                   to systematically survey three key wetting
                   properties: contact angle hysteresis, critical
                   pressure, and minimum energy wetting barrier. For
                   each, we uncover multiple competing mechanisms,
                   leading to the development of quantitative models and
                   correction of inaccurate assumptions in prevailing
                   models. Second, we combine these analyses
                   simultaneously, demonstrating the power of this
                   strategy by optimizing structures that are designed
                   to overcome challenges in two emerging applications:
                   membrane distillation and digital microfluidics. As
                   the wetting properties are antagonistically coupled,
                   this multifaceted approach is essential for optimal
                   design. When large surveys are impractical, we show
                   that genetic algorithms enable efficient
                   optimization, offering speedups of up to 10,000

                   transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run,
                   climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic
                   understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on
                   how to generate and stabilize around
                   near–steady-state movement in a single mode. We
                   still know little about how locomotor transitions
                   emerge from physical interaction with complex
                   terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on
                   geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them.
                   Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in
                   complex three-dimensional (3D) terrain occur
                   probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we
                   show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the
                   underlying physical principles. We discovered that
                   locomotor transitions of animals and robots
                   self-propelled through complex 3D terrain correspond
                   to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy
                   landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape
                   basins separated by potential energy barriers.
                   Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory
                   self-propulsion helps the system stochastically
                   escape from one basin and reach another to make
                   transitions. Escape is more likely toward lower
                   barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly
                   similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic
                   systems. Analogous to free-energy landscapes for
                   multipathway protein folding transitions, our energy
                   landscape approach from first principles is the
                   beginning of a statistical physics theory of
                   multipathway locomotor transitions in complex
                   terrain. This will not only help understand how the
                   organization of animal behavior emerges from
                   multiscale interactions between their neural and
                   mechanical systems and the physical environment, but

                   the large, intractable locomotor-terrain parameter

                   limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
                   (L-BFGS) optimizer for the dimer translation greatly
                   improves the convergence compared to the previously
                   used conjugate gradient algorithm. It also saves one
                   energy and gradient calculation per dimer iteration.
                   Extrapolation of the gradient during repeated dimer
                   rotations reduces the computational cost to one
                   gradient calculation per dimer rotation. The L-BFGS
                   algorithm also improves convergence of the rotation.
                   Thus, three to four energy and gradient evaluations
                   are needed per iteration at the beginning of a
                   transition state search, while only two are required
                   close to convergence. Moreover, we apply the dimer
                   method in internal coordinates to reduce coupling
                   between the degrees of freedom. Weighting the
                   coordinates can be used to apply chemical knowledge
                   about the system and restrict the transition state
                   search to only part of the system while minimizing
                   the remainder. These improvements led to an efficient
                   method for the location of transition states without
                   the need to calculate the Hessian. Thus, it is
                   especially useful in large systems with expensive
                   gradient evaluations. {\textcopyright} 2008 American

                   energy paths in barrier-crossing events. In this new

                   to the direction normal to the string is eliminated
                   and the full potential force is used in the evolution

                   modified to find saddle points around a given minimum
                   on a potential energy landscape using the location of
                   this minimum as only input. In the modified method
                   the string is evolved by gradient flow in path space,
                   with one of its end points fixed at the minimum and
                   the other end point (the climbing image) evolving
                   towards a saddle point according to a modified
                   potential force in which the component of the
                   potential force in the tangent direction of the
                   string is reversed. The use of a string allows us to
                   monitor the evolution of the climbing image and
                   prevent its escape from the basin of attraction of
                   the minimum. This guarantees that the string always

                   compare its performance with that of the method
                   developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines
                   cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps.
                   Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method
                   is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and
                   is better able to use additional storage to
                   accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS
                   method can be greatly accelerated by means of a
                   simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method
