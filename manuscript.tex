\begin{abstract}
  Locating transition states is crucial for investigating transition mechanisms in wide-ranging phenomena, from atomistic to macroscale systems.
  Existing methods, however, can struggle in problems with a large number of degrees of freedom, on-the-fly adaptive remeshing and coarse-graining, and energy landscapes that are locally flat or discontinuous.
  To resolve these challenges, we introduce a new double-ended method, the Binary-Image Transition State Search (BITSS).
  It uses just two states that converge to the transition state, resulting in a fast, flexible, and memory-efficient method.
  We demonstate its versatility by applying BITSS to three very different classes of problems: Lennard-Jones clusters, shell buckling, and multiphase phase-field models.

\section{Introduction}
Transition states are central to the description of reconfiguration mechanisms for systems in chemistry, condensed matter physics, and engineering.
Historically, many computational methods for locating transition states have grown from an atomistic or particulate perspective.
These have proven to be important tools for understanding, for example, protein folding \cite{Bryngelson1995,Onuchic1997}, biological and industrial catalysis \cite{Boehr2006,Kerns2015,Guo2018a}, quantum tunnelling \cite{Richardson2016,Vaillant2019}, crystallisation \cite{Richard2018}, and cluster formation \cite{Wales1998,Wales2012}.

More recently, it is increasingly being recognised that transition states are useful in mesoscale or macroscale systems.
Here, the minimum energy barriers provide important lower bounds to the energy input required for transitions to occur.
This has been used to understand failure in structural engineering applications \cite{Panter2019,Hutchinson2018}, for the development of super liquid-repellent surfaces \cite{Zhang2014,Panter2019b,Amabili2017}, and investigating locomotion through complex terrain for robotics \cite{Othayoth2020}.
Moreover, it is becoming desirable to tailor elastic deformation transitions to enable technologies such as advanced deployable structures \cite{Filipov2015,Zhai2018}, mechanical sensors and actuators \cite{Bertoldi2017,Truby2016,Chi2022,Bonfanti2020}, and energy absorbers \cite{Shan2015,Giri2021} to name but a few.

Existing transition state search methods generally fall into two categories, single- and double-ended methods.
Single-ended methods are initialised at a single state and attempt to climb to a nearby saddle point.
Examples include eigenvector following \cite{Cerjan1981}, the dimer method \cite{Heyden2005,Kastner2008,Zhang2016}, and climbing image methods \cite{E2007,Ren2013}.
Double-ended methods, such as the string method \cite{E2002,E2007} and doubly-nudged elastic band (DNEB) \cite{Trygubenko2004}, involve initialising a chain of states between two minima and then minimising the total energy of the chain.
An appropriate interpolation must be used for the initialisation, which can be challenging to produce \cite{Wales2012a}.
These double-ended methods also provide an estimate for the full transition pathway in addition to approximating the transition state.

However, a large range of landscapes prove challenging or impossible to explore via these methods.
One key problem arises from the push towards larger and more complex systems \cite{Trefethen2013,Shalf2020,Alexander2020}, resulting in the need to develop algorithms that are more memory and computationally efficient, and can incorporate advanced optimisation strategies such as on-the-fly adaptive remeshing and coarse-graining.
Current double-ended methods require a chain of tens of states to gain an accurate approximation, and have issues with remeshing due to the different number of degrees of freedom for each state.
Single-ended methods are not well suited for identifying specific pathways and can spend a large amount of time searching for undesired transition states.
Another major challenge in studying complex energy landscapes relates to the presence of locally flat or discontinuous regions, such as when considering patchy \cite{McMullen2018,Nguemaha2018,Chen2018b} and hard-body \cite{Richard2018,Santra2018} interactions in atomistic simulations, systems of polymer chains \cite{Mokkonen2016}, or collision constraints for macroscopic objects \cite{Wriggers2006}.
Flat zero-modes in the landscape pose issues for single-ended search methods that rely only upon local information.
Specialist treatment can sometimes be used such as in the case of global rotation and translation \cite{Page1988}, but they are thwarted by local zero-modes.
Meanwhile, current methods cannot typically be applied in the case of discontinuous potentials, or where the gradient is prohibitively expensive to compute, because continuous, differentiable optimisation functions are required.

In this work we introduce a new method, the Binary-Image Transition State Search (BITSS), and using a range of different applications, we will demonstrate how BITSS addresses each of the above challenges.
BITSS is a double-ended method that uses just two states that converge toward a transition state from either side, therefore combining aspects of the two traditional transition state search categories.
In addition, unlike other double-ended methods, BITSS does not require any initial interpolation.


\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{BITSS method}

  }
\end{figure}

The method begins by first initialising the states, $\bm{x}_1$ and $\bm{x}_2$, in the basins of attraction of different local minima, such as the two blue spots in the 2d potential in \cref{fig:toy2d}a.
These can be set to the minima, but this is not a necessary requirement.
The energies of these two states are then minimised, while constraining their separation.
This is iteratively reduced to zero, such that, at iteration $i$, their separation is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diteration}
  d_i = (1 - f) d_{i-1}.
\end{equation}
With $d_0$ as the separation between the two initial states.
A reduction factor of $f = 0.5$ is successful for most applications, but this can be made smaller to ensure that the states do not slide off the ridge between the two basins of attraction.
Different metrics may be used to compute the distance.
%######
To further ensure that neither state is pulled over the ridge, a secondary constraint enforces equal energies for the two states.
Using this strategy, the two states will meet at the lowest point on the ridge - the transition state.

The two constraints are implemented using energy penalty terms, which result in driving forces on the two states if the constraints are not met, such as in \cref{fig:toy2d}b.
Including these energy penalty terms gives the total BITSS energy for the pair of states,
\begin{multline}\label{eq:bitss}
  E_\text{BITSS}(\bm{x}_1, \bm{x}_2) = E_1 + E_2
    + \kappa_e \left( E_1 - E_2 \right) ^2 \\
    + \kappa_d \left( \mathrm{d}(\bm{x}_1, \bm{x}_2) - d_i \right) ^2,
\end{multline}
where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the single state energies, $\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_d$ parametrise the strengths of the energy and distance constraints, and $\mathrm{d}(\bm{x}_1, \bm{x}_2)$ is the measure of distance between the two states.

In this work the L-BFGS algorithm is chosen to minimise this energy, owing to its fast convergence and low memory requirement for large numbers of degrees of freedom \cite{Liu1989}.
However, any other minimisation method can be used instead.

To ensure that the transition state is located successfully, the constraint strengths $\kappa_d$ and $\kappa_e$ are updated as the algorithm proceeds using information from the system.
They are initially calculated at the start of each minimisation, and regularly recalculated throughout (once per 100 iterations is used in this work).
They are set using the following equations such that each term in the gradient of \cref{eq:bitss} is of a similar size,
\begin{gather}
  \kappa_e = \frac {\alpha} {2 E_B},
  \label{eq:ke}
  \\
  \kappa_d = \max \left(
    \frac {\sqrt{\abs{\grad E_1}^2 + \abs{\grad E_2}^2}} {2\sqrt{2} \beta d_i} \; , \;
    \frac{E_B}{\beta d_i^2} \right),
  \label{eq:kd}
\end{gather}
where $\grad E_1$ and $\grad E_2$ are the gradients of the energies of the two states, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters with recommended values of $\alpha = 10$ and $\beta = 0.1$ (see supplementary information).
Here, $E_B$ is an estimation for the current energy barrier; evaluated using the difference between the highest energy along a linear interpolation between the two states and the average energy of the two states.

In practice, when numerically minimising, the states will jump about slightly which can result in large gradients perpendicular to the optimal movement direction.
To reduce this effect, the gradients used in \cref{eq:kd} are projected in the direction of the separation between the two states:
\begin{equation}
  \abs{\grad E_n} \approx \frac {\abs{(\bm{x}_1 - \bm{x}_2) \cdot \grad E_n}} {\abs{\bm{x}_1 - \bm{x}_2}}.
\end{equation}

In summary, the method involves iteratively performing the following three steps:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
  \item Reduce the constrained separation, according to \cref{eq:diteration}.
  \item Minimise the potential of the pair of states, \cref{eq:bitss}.
  \item Recompute the constraint coefficients, $\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_d$, at regular intervals using \cref{eq:ke,eq:kd}.
\end{enumerate}
This process is completed once a suitable convergence criterion is reached.
This can either be based upon the separation between the states, or the size of gradient at the midpoint between them.

Using this approach, the typical trajectories of the states are demonstrated for a simple 2D potential in \cref{fig:toy2d}a.
Initially, the lower energy state jumps up to satisfy the equal energy constraint and then moves to minimise the separation without increasing its energy.
Then, the two states converge directly towards one another, before being deflected towards the saddle in the ridge.
Consequently, if there are multiple possible pathways between two states, BITSS will be biased towards identifying those that are more direct or with lower energy.
Furthermore, the final two states are positioned either side of the transition state in the direction of the negative curvature eigenvector, $\bm{\hat{\tau}}$ (\cref{fig:toy2d}c).
So, BITSS automatically identifies the `reactive mode' and associated eigenvalue in addition to the transition state.

Once BITSS has identified the transition state, it is possible to find the full minimum energy pathway by tracing the trajectory of downhill minimisations from the two final states, either side of the transition state.
In the case where there is a chain of transition states between the two starting minima, BITSS will identify the transition state with the highest energy in the chain.
If all of transition states or the full pathway are desired instead, BITSS can be continually repeated from one of the minima downhill from the located transition state and one of the initial minima until the initial minima are piecewise connected by a full pathway.


\subsection{Speed Comparison}
\begin{figure*}[tb]
  \includegraphics{speedtest.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:speedtest}
    Comparisons between BITSS, DNEB, and the string method in the convergence to the transition state as a function of the number of calculations of the energy gradient.
    Three test systems are used: (a) a Lennard-Jones seven-particle cluster, (b) cylindrical shell buckling, and (c) wetting of a chemically-striped surface.
    The configurations shown correspond to the two minimum energy states and the transition state, marked by an asterisk.
    The string method and DNEB are repeated with a differing number of images, as listed in the legend in (c).
  }
\end{figure*}

As a result of the BITSS method using only two states, it has the potential to be significantly faster than chain-of-states approaches which typically use tens of states.
This is tested here by measuring the speed of convergence to the transition state for BITSS in comparison with the string method and DNEB for three diverse systems, exhibiting a broad range of energy landscapes.
Details of each are presented in the methods section.

The first system is a two-dimensional, seven-particle cluster, interacting via a Lennard-Jones pair potential.
This is a frequently used test system for studying transition rates \cite{Wales2002,Passerone2001}.
Here, the \num{14} degrees of freedom are the particle coordinates.
The characteristic transition shown in \cref{fig:speedtest}a sees a particle rearrangement between two close-packed clusters.

The second system is an elastic cylindrical shell, modelled by a triangulated mesh of nodes, which interact via extensional and angular springs.
The \num{35400} degrees of freedom are the node coordinates in three-dimensional space.
The characteristic transition in \cref{fig:speedtest}b shows the formation of a stable dimple from an initially unbuckled cylinder.
This transition is essential to capture to predict mechanical failure under strain \cite{Panter2019,Virot2017}.

The final system involves a droplet situated on a chemically striped surface with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
Droplet transitions on patterned surfaces are vital to understand as powerful bio-inspired liquid manipulation strategies  \cite{Kusumaatmaja2006,Brown2016}.
In the example shown in \cref{fig:speedtest}c, a droplet transitions from two hydrophilic patches to one patch.
Here, the system is represented by a diffuse-interface model, in which the \num{40000} degrees of freedom are the local fluid compositions at each site of the discretised domain.

Convergence is measured using the distance from the transition state.
For BITSS, the average of the two states is used for this, whereas for the chain-of-states methods, the closest point on a cubic spline interpolation is used.
The speed of this convergence is evaluated through comparison with the number of calculations of the potential gradient for a single state.

The results for this test, shown in \cref{fig:speedtest}, demonstrate two main advantages for the BITSS method.
Firstly, the slope illustrates that the rate of convergence is indeed much greater for the BITSS method.
It is matched only by the initial rates of DNEB and the string method using fewer than ten images, however these soon slow and are relatively inaccurate.
Secondly, the BITSS method can more accurately approximate the transition state by orders of magnitude, particularly for the wetting example where the other methods do not significantly improve upon the initial pathway estimate.
Therefore, unlike these other double-ended methods, BITSS does not require a second approach to accurately locate the transition state.


\subsection{Adaptive discretisation}
\label{sec:adaptive}
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics{adaptivemesh.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:adaptivemesh}
    (a) Snapshots of the BITSS method applied to the buckling of a cylinder with a changing mesh.
        The radial displacement relative the unbuckled cylinder is shown, as well as the underlying triangular mesh.
    (b) BITSS applied to the striped wetting example with different resolutions for the two states.
        Each grid cell denotes 50x50 lattice nodes.
        The zoomed axis shows the difference in the fluid interface between the two final states, as well as the approximated transition state (solid black line).
        This is compared to the transition state found using a high resolution (dashed line).
  }
\end{figure}

Adaptive remeshing and coarse-graining are widely used techniques that we can utilise to further increase the efficiency of BITSS.
These techniques cause issues for existing double-ended methods because the coupled states may end up with different degrees of freedom.
However, in BITSS the only direct coupling is in the distance measure, $\mathrm{d}(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_2)$, which is relatively easy to adapt.
Here we demonstrate the use of adaptive remeshing by considering two separate issues.

Firstly, we show in \cref{fig:adaptivemesh}a that BITSS is able to handle the discretisation adapting, and the number of degrees of freedom changing, as the method runs.
For this we use the cylindrical buckling example with the resolution increasing from 40 to 100 triangles around the cylinder, corresponding to an increase from \num{1760} to \num{11000} degrees of freedom.
This demonstrates that BITSS is able to converge to the transition state so long as the remeshing is not so significant as to shift a state into the basin of attraction of the other minima.

In the second test, shown in \cref{fig:adaptivemesh}b, we demonstrate the use of different meshes for the two states in the striped wetting example.
In this case, the distance measure is adapted by interpolating one state onto the other mesh and computing the Euclidean distance.
However, for some applications a simpler measure may be sufficient, such as the difference between average values of the system.
Using this approach, BITSS is able to closely approach the transition state.
The precision of this convergence is now limited by the transition state energy differing slightly on each grid, but this effect will be reduced when using an adaptive method or a higher resolution.


\subsection{Complex landscapes}
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics{flatdiscontinuous.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:flatdiscontinuous}

    (c) Plot of the discontinuous potential.
        The repulsive section of the standard Lennard-Jones potential is also shown in grey.
  }
\end{figure}

The final challenges we will address are those related to complex landscapes that prove challenging for previous algorithms.
The first is the presence of flat regions in the landscape.
\Cref{fig:flatdiscontinuous}a shows BITSS applied to a 2D landscape with two such regions (i \& ii) that are flat in the $x$-direction.
We see BITSS is able to successfully converge past these flat regions, even with one very close to the transition state (ii).
In these regions there are no driving forces due to the potential and the energy constraint, which use purely local information about the gradient.
However, the distance constraint continues to pull the states together, preventing them from getting stuck.
When only a single state has a zero-gradient mode then the other is likely to slide down the potential slightly (iii), but the two states still remain either side of the dividing ridge and so the result is unaffected.


Finally, we investigate the application of BITSS to systems with undefined gradients, such as when the landscape is discontinuous.
To account for this, the equations for the coefficients must be adapted to not depend upon the gradients, and a gradient-free minimiser (simulated annealing) is used.
These changes are detailed in the methods section.
This has been tested using a Lennard-Jones 7-particle cluster with hard cores, resulting in a discontinuous landscape.
Using the gradient-free approach, BITSS is able to successfully find the transition states, allowing us to plot the disconnectivity graph of the system, shown in \cref{fig:flatdiscontinuous}b.
Compared with the results for the standard Lennard-Jones cluster, the energies of the minima are largely unchanged, but the energies of the transition states are found to be slightly higher.
This indicates that the particles in the Lennard-Jones cluster cut the corner slightly as they transition, whereas this is not possible using the discontinuous potential, resulting in higher energies.
Despite this gradient-free method being feasible, it is worth noting that a gradient-based approach is significantly more efficient, and so should be preferred if possible.


\section{Conclusion}
Overall, we have developed the binary image transition state search (BITSS) algorithm for the efficient location of transition states in traditionally challenging landscapes.
Principally, the demonstrated speed and memory-efficiency will be key as we move towards simulating systems with increasingly large numbers of degrees of freedom, such as in large biomolecules, or with increasingly fine resolution, such as in finite element domains.

A second source of efficiency in the BITSS method comes from the ability to adaptively change the degrees of freedom as the algorithm proceeds.
We demonstrated how transition states could be found by both increasing the resolution upon convergence, and coupling systems with different discretisations.
The ease of coupling two copies of a system and adaptive remeshing, now leads to the possibility of incorporating BITSS into existing optimisation methods, such as surface evolver or finite element analysis software, to provide important energy barrier functionality. 

Finally, we showed how BITSS can be used to survey discontinuous energy landscapes, demonstrated for a system of attractive hard-core particles.
This opens up possibilities for studying a broad range of systems previously out of reach of conventional landscape methods, but where transition information is valuable.
These include systems with very short range interactions or contact forces, such as in colloidal clusters, wrinkling and buckling of elastic materials, or locomotion and environmental interaction in robotics.

The distance metric between the two BITSS images proves interesting to analyse further in the future.
One question that emerges is whether transition states can be located by coupling two images through a small number of collective properties, rather than the total distance between all degrees of freedom in the system.
A second question is that for landscapes with multiple pathways between states, how can the distance metric be biased to access transition states different from the most direct one? Overall, these will enable BITSS to access even more challenging landscapes, and those not yet amenable to traditional landscape exploration techniques.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{BITSS: Changes for undefined gradients}
A couple of alterations to the method must be made to account for situations where the gradients are unknown.
First, the calculation of $\kappa_d$ in \cref{eq:kd} must be adapted to avoid the use of gradients.
This can be done by simply removing the first term and just using the second term in the equation.
Secondly, L-BFGS can no longer be used because it requires knowledge of the gradients.
We must instead use a minimiser that does not require a differentiable optimisation function, for which we use simulated annealing \cite{Kirkpatrick1983}.
This has a chance of randomly jumping one state over the dividing barrier, but we can reduce this probability by limiting the initial temparature and maximum random displacement.
We typically employ $T_0 = E_B / 10$, and $d_\text{max} = d(\bm{x}_1, \bm{x}_2) / 100$.

\subsection{Adaptive discretisation test details}
Here we provide the details for the interpolations and mapping involved in the two examples demonstrating the feasibility of using an adaptive discretisation method.
For the cylindrical buckling example with a changing mesh, the resolution is refined each time the separation between the two states has halved, and is performed at the end of each iteration of the BITSS method. 
This involves the number of triangles around the circumference of the cylinder increasing along the sequence: $40 \rightarrow 60 \rightarrow 80 \rightarrow 100$; with the number of degrees of freedom increasing by: $1760 \rightarrow 3960 \rightarrow 7040 \rightarrow 11000$.
The positions of the nodes on the new grid, $\{\bm{n}_i\}$, are determined by linear interpolation from the previous grid $\{\bm{p}_i\}$, using the positions of the unbuckled meshes, $\{\bm{n'}_i\}$ and $\{\bm{p'}_i\}$.
For each node of the new grid, $\bm{n'}_i$, the triangle that contains it is first identified, which we will denote $\{\bm{p'}_1,\bm{p'}_2,\bm{p'}_3\}$, and the barycentric coordinates of the point are computed, $\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\}$.
The new position is then given by $\bm{n}_i = \lambda_1 \bm{p}_1 + \lambda_2 \bm{p}_2 + \lambda_3 \bm{p}_3$.

In the wetting example with different resolutions for the two states, the distance is obtained by first mapping the phase field from the higher resolution grid, $\{\phi_{k,l} | k,l \in \{0,1,\cdots,399\}\}$, to the low resolution grid, $\{\phi'_{i,j} | i,j \in \{0,1,\cdots,199\}\}$.
Because a square grid is used with a resolution ratio of two, the mapping involves averaging each 2x2 block to a single point:
\begin{equation}
  \phi'_{i,j} = \frac{1}{4} \left( \phi_{2i,2j} + \phi_{2i+1,2j} + \phi_{2i,2j+1} + \phi_{2i+1,2j+1} \right).
\end{equation}
Then the separation from the other state, $\{\widetilde{\phi}_{i,j}\}$, is computed using the 2-norm,
\begin{equation}
  d = \sqrt{\sum_{i,j} \left( \phi'_{i,j} - \widetilde{\phi}_{i,j} \right)^2}.
\end{equation}
Finally, the gradient of the distance with respect to each point must be mapped back to the higher-resolution grid, which is done by assigning a quarter of each component back to its the original four points:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial d}{\partial \phi_{k,l}} =
    \frac{\partial \phi'_{i,j}}{\partial \phi_{k,l}} \frac{\partial d}{\partial \phi'_{i,j}} =
    \frac{1}{4} \frac{\partial d}{\partial \phi'_{i,j}} =
    \frac{1}{4} \frac{\phi'_{i,j} - \widetilde{\phi}_{i,j}}{d},
\end{equation}
where $k \in \{2i, 2i+1\}$, and $l \in \{2j, 2j+1\}$.

\subsection{Energy and gradient expressions for the example systems}
\subsubsection{Particle cluster system}
In the particle cluster example system, the Lennard-Jones potential is used for the interaction between each pair of particles.
Therefore, the potential and its gradient for each pair of particles are
\begin{gather}
  E = 4\epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right], \\
  \frac{\partial E}{\partial \bm{x}_1} = -\frac{\partial E}{\partial \bm{x}_2} =
    \frac{24 \epsilon (\bm{x}_2 - \bm{x}_1)}{r^2} \left[ 2 \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right],
\end{gather}
where $\bm{x}_1$ and $\bm{x}_2$ are the positions of the two particles, $r$ is their separation, $\epsilon$ is the interaction strength, and $\sigma$ is the particle radius.

\subsubsection{Cylindrical buckling system}
A 2D triangular mesh is used to model the cylindrical buckling system, with the ends of the cylinder fixed in place to apply an axial compression of 0.14\%.
The energy of the system is evaluated by treating all bonds in the mesh as an elastic spring to obtain the stretching energy, and all pairs of adjacent triangles to be connected by elastic hinges, providing the bending energy.
Their expressions are given by
\begin{equation}
  E = \sum_i k^S_i (r_i - r^0_i)^2 + \sum_j k^B_j [1 + \cos(\theta_j - \theta^0_j)].
\end{equation}
The first term is the stretching energy, where $r_i$ is the length, $r^0_i$ is the equilibrium length, and $k^S_i$ is the stretching rigidity of bond $i$.
The second term provides the bending energy, where $\theta_j$ is the dihedral angle, $\theta^0_j$ is the equilibrium angle, and $k^B_j$ is the bending rigidity of hinge $j$.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \includegraphics{fig/BAHschematic.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:BAHschematic}
    Schematic of the bar and hinge model showing the relevent parameters for a single hinge element. $h_i$ and $\bm{\hat{n}}_i$ denote the height and unit normal of each triangle respectively.
  }
\end{figure}
The gradient of the energy can be obtained by individually considering the stretching and bending energies of a single bond and hinge.
For simplicity, we will ignore the index for the bond and hinge.
Using the variables shown in the schematic in \cref{fig:BAHschematic}, the gradient of the stretching energy of the bond between $\bm{x}_2$ and $\bm{x}_3$ is given by,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial E^S}{\partial \bm{x}_2} = - \frac{\partial E^S}{\partial \bm{x}_3} = 
    2 k^S (r - r^0) (\bm{x_2} - \bm{x_3}).
\end{equation}
The gradients of the bending energy of the hinge are
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial E^B}{\partial \bm{x}_1} &= k^B \sin(\theta - \theta^0) \frac{\bm{\hat{n}}_a}{h_a}, \\
  \frac{\partial E^B}{\partial \bm{x}_2} &= - k^B \sin(\theta - \theta^0) \left[\frac{\bm{\hat{n}}_a}{h_a} + \frac{\bm{\hat{n}}_a + \bm{\hat{n}}_b}{r}\right], \\
  \frac{\partial E^B}{\partial \bm{x}_3} &= - k^B \sin(\theta - \theta^0) \left[\frac{\bm{\hat{n}}_b}{h_b} + \frac{\bm{\hat{n}}_a + \bm{\hat{n}}_b}{r}\right], \\
  \frac{\partial E^B}{\partial \bm{x}_4} &= k^B \sin(\theta - \theta^0) \frac{\bm{\hat{n}}_b}{h_b}.

\subsubsection{Striped wetting system}
This modelled on a 200x200 2D grid (and 400x400 in \cref{sec:adaptive}) using a phase-field model \cite{Panter2019b}, which has an order parameter, $\phi(\bm{r})$, representing the phase of the liquid ($\phi=-1$ for gas, $\phi=1$ for liquid).
The energy functional has four separate terms,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phasefield}
  E[\phi] = E^B[\phi] + E^I[\phi] + E^S[\phi] + E^V[\phi].
\end{equation}
The first term, $E^B$, uses a double well potential to set values of $\phi=\pm1$ in the bulk.
The second term then provides the interfacial energy between the liquid and gas by imposing an energy penalty to gradients in $\phi$.
$E^S$ is the solid-liquid interaction energy, which sets the contact angles of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to 60\si{\degree} and 110\si{\degree}, respectively.
Finally, $E^V$ constrains the volume of the liquid drop by penalising any variation from the target volume.

These four sections of the phase-field model are obtained using the following equations,
\begin{align}
  E^B[\phi] &= \sum_i \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left( \frac{{\phi_i}^4}{4} - \frac{{\phi_i}^2}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \right) \upDelta V,\\
  E^I[\phi] &= \sum_i \frac{\epsilon}{2} \abs{\grad \phi_i}^2 \upDelta V,\\
  E^S[\phi] &= \sum_j \sqrt{2}\cos\theta_j \left( \frac{{\phi_j}^3}{6} - \frac{\phi_j}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) \upDelta S,\\
  E^V[\phi] &= k_V \left[ \sum_i \frac{\phi_i + 1}{2} \upDelta V - V_0 \right]^2,
\end{align}
where the index $i$ includes all of the nodes, while $j$ represents the nodes along the solid surface.
$\upDelta V$ and $\upDelta S$ are, respectively, the volume and solid surface areas contained by each individual node.
$\epsilon$ is the liquid-gas interface width (set to 2.5 lattice units), $\theta_j$ is the contact-angle with the solid surface, and $V_0$ is the constrained volume of the liquid drop.
The strength of the volume constraint is parametrised by $k_V$ for which we use a value of $10^4$.
The gradients of these terms are given by,
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial E^B}{\partial \phi_i} &= \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left( {\phi_i}^3 - \phi_i \right) \upDelta V,\\
  \frac{\partial E^I}{\partial \phi_i} &= \frac{\epsilon}{2} \left[
    \frac{\partial \abs{\grad \phi_i}^2}{\partial \phi_i} +
    \sum_k\frac{\partial \abs{\grad \phi_k}^2}{\partial \phi_i} \right] \upDelta V,\\
  \frac{\partial E^S}{\partial \phi_j} &= \sqrt{2}\cos\theta_j \left( \frac{{\phi_j}^2}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \upDelta S,\\
  \frac{\partial E^V}{\partial \phi_i} &= k_V \left[ \sum_{i'} \frac{\phi_{i'} + 1}{2} \upDelta V - V_0 \right] \upDelta V,
\end{align}
where index $k$ denotes neighboring nodes at which the evaluation of the gradient uses $\phi_i$.
